            <h2 class="text-3xl">...me</h2>
            <p>I have an honours degree in economics from the University of Adelaide</p>
            <p>I work as a software developer in Medell√≠n, Colombia, but am currently in Australia, where I was
                visiting for a wedding when my flights home were cancelled.</p>
            <p>If I had the choice (and the ability), I'd much rather spend most of my time on music and art. The
                only things that really matter in life.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl">...this website</h2>
            <p>This blog exists primarily as a tool for learning. Both about the things I write about, as well as the
                process of building and maintaining a blog. At the moment there's not much evidence of progress in
                either of these areas, but maybe with time that will change.</p>
