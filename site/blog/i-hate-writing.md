It's hard. That's why it's good.

I find writing to be an extremely painful process. In fact, the sentence you're reading at this very moment has been through at least six iterations already. Such metaphorical blood-from-stone process is entirely the norm for me and has been so my whole life. Nevertheless, I love the written word.

Since childhood, when my imagination was captivated by the stories of Enid Blyton, no other format has been able to evoke such wonder and empathy as the written word. Over time, my appreciation for its power only grew. Through books, we are given the opportunity to peer directly into the minds of some of the greatest men and women the world has known. The knowledge they obtained through years of toil is at our fingertips. The only potential obstacles our own deficient willpower and inferior intellects.

$\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

$$f({x}) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
     \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
     \,d\xi$$

$$\begin{aligned}{c}

\nabla\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{f(d)\right\} &= \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{f_1(\delta).f_2(\delta)\right\} \\
      & = \exp(mt) \star \left\{\frac{l}{2\sqrt{\pi t^3}} \exp(-l^2/{4t})\right\} \\
      & = F_1 * F_2

\end{aligned}$$

Unfortunately my profound appreciation for the power of writing was never reflected in any innate writing ability, making it something I've generally avoided as much as possible. But the reality of a curious mind and a desire to make decisions grounded in empirical truth and logical consistency compel me to take up the challenge. As Henrik Warne says on his excellent [programming blog](https://henrikwarne.com/2017/11/26/6-years-of-thoughts-on-programming/).

> Formulating or explaining something in writing makes me think it through really carefully. The act of writing it down exposes gaps in my arguments and knowledge, forcing me to clarify my own thinking.

Good writing is the death of half-formed, vague and inconsistent thoughts (or at least it should be). In this vein, this journal (journal sounds much nicer than blog) is written for the benefit of the author, rather than the reader. My attempts at writing will have as their objective a better understanding of some miniscule slice of all that the universe offers us. Nothing more. Please keep that in mind if you happen to stumble across these pages.
