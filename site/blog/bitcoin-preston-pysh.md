## Introduction

I frequently listen to finance and investing themed podcasts these days and one thing that has become increasingly
apparent is the number of very smart people who think bitcoin will play a significant role in a future financial
system. 

One of these people is Preston Pysh, co-host of the 'We Study Billionaires' podcast. The podcast typically focuses 
on traditional stock-market investing, and in particular [value investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing). 
Many of the first proponents of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were early adopters motivated by [crypto-anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-anarchism) 
ideals, rather than experienced investors, and while the opinions of people from that background are very valuable, 
when it comes to the potential for bitcoin as an investment asset, I find the thoughts of someones who speaks regularly 
to very successful professional investors and has spent years studying and acting in the markets especially interesting. 

In this article I'll attempt to summarise the scenario he outlined in [episode 288](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/episodes/tip288-current-stock-market-conditions-2020-crash-covid-19/) 
of the podcast that would see bitcoin's price increase from its current level (approx $7000 as of this moment) to a six
figure value (at least) within the next couple of years.  

Given that I wasted a lot of time obtaining a degree in economics, I might be forgiven for hoping that the mechanisms at play in this scenario were 
mostly familiar to me. Unfortunately the academic study of economics has very little to say about how the real world 
works, and this is especially apparent when it comes to money. 

Discussions about bitcoin and its role in a future world economy bring up a range of concepts related to money that are very easy to gloss over, but 
if delved into show themselves to be immensely complex and often philosophical in nature. Questions such as, why does money have value at all and 
why should I expect it to still have any value in the future? 

Then there are the pedantic but crucial distinctions in terms. For example how many of us can easily describe the difference between currency and money, 
or between fiat money and hard money. 

One particularly important concept is that of a 'reserve currency'. What does it mean? How does a currency become a reserve currency? And perhaps 
most importantly, at what point does a reserve currency stop being a reserve currency? 

In addition to these conceptual topics, much of the scenario depends on an understanding of the mechanics of finance. Of particular importance are 
the interactions between inflation, interest rates and asset prices, where the models describing these interactions are non-trivial for anyone not
already well versed in financial analysis.

The scenario outlined in this podcast episode touched on many of these matters, while leaving quite a bit of homework for anyone wants
to really understand the factors at play. These are subjects I intend to explore further in futures articles as I feel that they are vitally important
for understanding how the world works.

## An outline of the scenario 

1. A rapid contraction in demand due to the coronavirus shutdown leads to a period of [deflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation), 
causing companies to either drastically reduce production or go out of business. The end result is a drastic reduction in the supply of various
products and commodities.

2. At the same time we will have huge government participation in all areas of the economy. Including bailing out of corporations, state and 
local governments and individuals (with various forms of universal basic income).

3. Once the acute phase of the shutdown is over, demand comes back quickly, especially for commodities like oil, 
but with a lot of supply capacity removed during the crisis, supply won't be able to keep up and commodity prices will 'rip higher'.
The price rises will cause measures of inflation to 'skyrocket'.

4. Interest rates are set relative to inflation and will therefore increase rapidly in response to inflation. Since interest rates 
are an important component of the [Capital Asset Pricing Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model), which 
many stock market investors use to make investment decisions. The sudden rise in interest rates will cause a big sell off in 
the stock market and a dramatic decrease in valuations.

5. Bonds coupon rates (interest rates) are similarly defined relative to inflation, paying a premium above the prevailing
rate of inflation. A rapid increase in bond rates will cause the value (price) of bonds issued earlier to be 'wiped out' since no one wants 
to buy a bond that pays a rate far below the rate of inflation.

6. The preceding steps lead to an [inflationary depression](https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/18690/inflationary-recession-vs-deflationary-recession), 
where nominal prices rise at the same time as the economy is contracting.[^1] Under this scenario the real value of the 
money we earn (meaning the amount of stuff we can actually buy) will be decreasing, which encourages people to exchange their money for
goods that retain their value, such as land and commodities, as quickly as possible. 

## Discussion

TBC

[^1]: It's not clear to me, and Preston doesn't elaborate on, how exactly the inflationary depression follows. I'm familiar with 
arguments that suggest a much more valuable USD is likely in the short to medium term, due to its role as the world's reserve 
currency. 

    The argument says that there will be a shortage of USD in the world, because foreign governments and corporations hold 
    huge amounts (approx ~13 trillion of the top of my head) of USD denominated debt and require USD to meet their obligations. 
    However, because of the reduction in global output and international trade there will be much less USD available internationally. 
    This increased demand for available USD would see its value increase relative to other currencies.
